# Customer-Segmentation

## Problem Statement

A mall wants to get insights about their customers. They have data about cutomers purchasing behavior. We are going to build a system that can cluster customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior. This will help the mall to understand their customers better and make better business decisions. This could hypothetically help the mall understand the different types of customers that visit the mall and how they can target them better.

## Project Workflow

1. Load the data
2. Feature Selection
3. Preprocess the data
4. Analyze the data
5. Choose the optimum number of clusters
6. Feed the data to the clustering algorithm
7. Visualize the clusters
